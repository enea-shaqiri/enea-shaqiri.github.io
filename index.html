<h2> About Me </h2>
<p>
  Hi Internaut, my name is Enea! I have a MsC in pure Mathematics, and I am currently hunting for patterns and inefficiencies
  in the markets.
  I really enjoy topics that live in the intersection between Math and the
  real world. Many topics can be found in this intersection and I have had the pleasure to explore some of them.
  My current focus is on market microstructure and market making models. I find really cool that it is not
  too difficult to code a bot implementing strategies based on these models and have it trade live on the markets!
  I also enjoy warping my head around how to build complex strategies mixing esoteric derivatives like everlasting
  options and Uniswap V3.

<h2>About this blog</h2>

<p>
  Learning new stuff is always fun! I love that revelation moment when all the pieces of the puzzle fit together and
  you get a view of the full picture. The purpose of this blog is to structure my thoughts/notes about things
  I deem interesting and avoid forgetting the steps I have taken to understand them. You might find Math, Deep Learning,
  financial models, or a combination of the above! Stay tuned!
